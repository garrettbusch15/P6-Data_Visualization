SUMMARY

The prescribed data visualization is an overview the curated Titanic dataset by Udacity. This visualization is in conjunction with the Data Scientist course track and sheds a brief overview of elements involved in the course. With consideration to the Titanic, I was well aware of the story, which proved to be helpful in the type of insights I might pursue. In the case of this data analysis, I was able to determine that women & children as well as the upper class were most likely to have survived the incident.

DESIGN (prior changes to index_html_v1 were not recorded)

Changes I've incorporated were to simplify the groups I've utilized. Another design choice was to incorporate 2 additional graphs as well as a summary for the reader. I feel from including the summary I've made this into an author driven narrative; however, this is able to properly convey my overall message, which was that the was a significant difference in groups and how life was preserved on the Titanic.

index_html_v2: I've changed 3rd graphic (per the note below). 

FEEDBACK

My first feedback with this data was as so:

What do you notice in the visualization? The insightful graphs.
What questions do you have about the data? What are some of the percentages of survival per various groups?
What relationships do you notice? There was a key difference in various groups and the survivability.
What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization? From my perspective, that youth was something they attempted to save.
Is there something you donâ€™t understand in the graphic? Some of the missing x/y axis labels were missing and it was hard to know how this was scaled.

My next feedback is expected in my 1st submission to Udacity.

My second feedback was from a Udacity evaluation. The major changes from this review included: reconsidering the label/explaination piece used after my 3rd visual. Instead of using a lengthy explaination, I've converted to more of a complete graphic with legend that allows the reader to interprete the same finding. The other piece of feedback I integrated was inclusion of more notes in my javascript file.
